# OpenRA's Protocol Unofficial Documentation
> A Libre/Free Real Time Strategy game engine supporting early Westwood classics.

OpenRA's protocol official documentation (see [OpenRA.Game/Server/ProtocolVersion.cs](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/Server/ProtocolVersion.cs)) is pretty much kind of poor (better than some games, though).

This is my try of making a complete reverse-engineer to see how it works and how to even [implement your own server](https://github.com/ilaicraftYT/openra-server)

Most of the data is populated from OpenRA's source code, but I hope to add more with my own notes.
